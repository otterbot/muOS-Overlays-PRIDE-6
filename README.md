Included are overlays with normal and holo-style bezels with and without grids with the necessary configuration files. Credit to AntiKK for allowing me to edit his overlays and use his config files because I can't code to save my life.

# File Placement
Move the **OtterBot** folder to `mmc > MUOS > retroarch > overlays`

# Configuration
Instructions are included in the config files on how to set this up, but just in case, here are the instructions:

Use with `Main Menu > Settings > Video > Scaling > Integer Scale` set to **Off**

Aspect Ratio : **Custom**

Custom Aspect Ratio (Width) : **640**

Custom Aspect Ratio (Height) : **426**

# Usage
While playing a GBA game, open the quick menu and go to `On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset`.

Select **Parent Directory** until you get to the directory that contains the folder named **OtterBot**. Then go to `OtterBot > gba` and pick which overlay you prefer.

Go back to the quick menu and then go to **Overrides**.

If you want the selected bezel for all GBA games, select **Save Content Directory Overrides**.

If you want the selected bezel for just the current GBA game, select **Save Game Overrides**.
